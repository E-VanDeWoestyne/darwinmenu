# Darwin Menu
Darwin menu is a Plasma applet that provides a menu system similar to that found on other operating systems. It allows users to access frequently used system settings and session controls.

Menu supports adding custom commands, which can be placed in separate sub-menu or in common list.

Applet also provides "Force Quit" app, which can be opened with global shortcut. (Default: "**âŒ˜-âŒ¥-âŽ‹"**) ðŸ˜Š

Menu uses global theme, so will adapt to any Plasma style.
